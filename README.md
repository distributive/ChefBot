# ChefBot

A half-baked Discord bot for displaying recipes built from the source code of [Sahasrara](https://github.com/distributive/Sahasrara) written on top of [WarwickTabletop's Tablebot](https://github.com/WarwickTabletop/tablebot) (built on top of [discord-haskell](https://github.com/aquarial/discord-haskell)).

I made this as a joke in a single day and have no intention of maintaining it. If you're interested in taking over development please feel free to fork this repository or make your own copy from scratch in whichever language/framework of your choosing. Since ChefBot is based on a much larger and more intricate bot this is possibly the most over-engineered things I've ever made, so I would advise just starting again.
